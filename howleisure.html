</a>Kunstverein München, 2023 <br>
Performance and installation with music score conceived by Jan Kunkel, Vera Karlsson, and Alie O. <br>
<br>

The performance exemplarily uses the instituted properties of marriage to glance at its attempt to 
decorate labor as leisure in the name of (possessive) love and (naturalized) mirages of the “self.” 
As a public park, the Hofgarten conveys a popular scene for wedding photography. It is therefore 
often utilized as a stage to enact the holy union of wedlock, ensuring sentimental documentation 
and material perpetuation. Couples and their entourage overextend this scene until finally leaving 
it emptied.
<br>
<br>
Shells, fountains, and pleasure houses are symbols of the baroque architecture in the Hofgarten. 
Focusing on this historical continuation, the piece re-appropriates the garden as a scenery for the 
German tragic drama or Trauerspiel. It intently suspends modes of establishing and relinquishing 
the genre, remaining concerned with a shared un-realization of opulent violence as a form of 
(dis)possession. The figures of the Trauerspiel exhaust and overcome themselves in the final scene: 
from reenacting twosomes to self-abolition. how leisure always imitates labor thus examines 
performance as spectacle, disorganization, and collapse. <br>(words by Jan Kunkel) <br> (video edit Vera Karlsson)</p>
