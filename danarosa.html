The first release from collaborators Vera Karlsson and
Finlay Clark (Still House Plants), Dana Rosa melds together a
smeared and multi-directional cauldron of soulful drone, whispers of
the heart, ear-splitting bedroom-angst, meandering electronics and
playful percussive textures made by dragging the mic around the
studio.

It was a shared studio in south London. The glass ceiling drank in
the sunlight and held its heavy pregnant body suspended, buoyant,
in the air. There were gaps in the broken bricks and glass that
allowed a corporeal torrent of dried, anfractuous brambles and ivy
to dominate the airspace like blind aliens. Birds fed their young in
the nest situated amongst the drill bits. The young were soon
starved to death by the occupant cuckoo that also hatched there.
The coffee was so strong that it seemed to push the sweat out and
the heavy air held my hand like a lost child looking for someone,
anyone, in this tired and incessant oblivion.
