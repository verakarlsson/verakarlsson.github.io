Fermata, (2021) a collaboration between Vera Karlsson and <a href="https://uglyducklingpresse.org/contributors/iman-mohammed/"target="_blank">
Iman Mohammed</a>. The video is a result from our meeting at Gotland film institute for a four days during 
summer 2021. The work documents Iman's memores and relationship 
to the iland and specfic the penincula Fårö. Gotland is also the place where I grew up and our friendship
was formed later in Stockholm. The work discuss the impliations of beloning 
to a place and what that means. It ia also a portrait of Iman Mohammed, 
and includes the cinema and music that inspires her work as a poet. Specificly are Lost Highway and 
Cuadecuc, vampir, qouted in the film. The work also has an undertone of Ingmar Bergamns film Persona,
that aswell is set on Fårö. The title comes from Iman's second poerty collection "Fermata" (2018)
which she reads from. I filmed, edited and made the soundtrack for the work.
