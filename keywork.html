<br>
The video, 'Unless useless' follows a fractured ‘everyday’ psycological narrativ taking place in a 
made-up universe where all visible human labour have been replaced by automated machines and a 
sense of purpose seams detached. The protagonist has given up which in itself evokes a sense of 
agency. Each still in the video can be distributed and sold as a unique inkjet poster with added doodles by Vera. 
Together the posters creates a puzzle and a shared whole between shareholders. <br>
In the hallway, 7 inkjet prints from Veras notes, edited with pen and doddles. <br>
