Through doors becoming the walls <br>
20 inkjet prints on A4 on wall and 04:51 min video with sound. <br>
<br>
Following the exhibition Keywork with the video 'Unless useless' opening one week prior at bbberlin.
The photographs that constitutes the video are taken in the fire exit staircase and basement of the same 
housing building as Unless Useless. Each photo can be distributed and sold as unique inkjet posters 
with added doodles by Vera. Together the posters creates a puzzle and a shared whole between shareholders.

<!-- The sound is from a 88 keys classical piano played as one key is broken/untuned. -->
