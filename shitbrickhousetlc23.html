TLC23 was initiated by Artists Keira Fox and Katie Shannon in London in 2021, the collective recurrently collaborates with Berlin-based Artist Vera Karlsson. 
Frequently folding in the work of other artists, performers, sound engineers, musicians, designers, writers and photographers, they collectively investigate
themes of trauma, mania, release and protection with a distinctly feminist impulse. TLC23 is a collective, rooted in underground and experimental music,
emerging from the subcultures and alternative music scenes that shaped Fox and Shannon’s experiences as teenagers. The work exists at the intersections
of music, art, and performance, drawing on personal narratives and the transformative spaces found in these formative scenes. Themes related to 
gender- based violence, persecution, and bias often inform the work, particularly through a female-identifying perspective. By focusing on intersectional 
allyship as a guiding ethos, TLC23 create immersive environments where they and others perform, orchestrating spaces for collective experience and 
resilience in uncertain times. Through such events, their work is resistant to clear authorship, fluid in its means and modes of display, and heterogenous 
in the archiving and distribution of its documentation. Incorporating sound, music, print media, film, performance, sculpture and radio, TLC23 events 
become a site of both production and reception and as such inscribe viewers in a dynamic arena of complicity and voyeurship that is simultaneously 
reactive and restorative in its processes.
