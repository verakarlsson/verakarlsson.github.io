</a>Kunstverein München, 2023
The performance exemplarily uses the instituted properties of marriage to glance at its attempt to 
decorate labor as leisure in the name of (possessive) love and (naturalized) mirages of the “self.” 
As a public park, the Hofgarten conveys a popular scene for wedding photography. It is therefore 
often utilized as a stage to enact the holy union of wedlock, ensuring sentimental documentation 
and material perpetuation. Couples and their entourage overextend this scene until finally leaving 
it emptied.
<br>
<br>
Shells, fountains, and pleasure houses are symbols of the baroque architecture in the Hofgarten. 
Focusing on this historical continuation, the piece re-appropriates the garden as a scenery for the 
German tragic drama or Trauerspiel. It intently suspends modes of establishing and relinquishing 
the genre, remaining concerned with a shared un-realization of opulent violence as a form of 
(dis)possession. The figures of the Trauerspiel exhaust and overcome themselves in the final scene: 
from reenacting twosomes to self-abolition. how leisure always imitates labor thus examines 
performance as spectacle, disorganization, and collapse.
<br>
Performance and installation with music score conceived by Jan Kunkel, Vera Karlsson, and Alie O.

Keywork at<a href="https://www.bbberlin.biz/vera"target="_blank"> bbberlin </a>,  2022.
Press release; The video, 'Unless useless' follows a fractured ‘everyday’ psycological narrativ taking place in a 
made-up universe where all visible human labour have been replaced by automated machines and a 
sense of purpose seams detached. The protagonist has given up which itself evokes a sense of 
agency. Each still in the video can be distributed as a unique inkjet poster with added doodles by Vera. 
Together they create a shared whole. <br>
In the hallway, 7 inkjet prints from Veras notes, edited with pen and doddles.

The supporting acts are united by their formative encounters with Bruce Gilbert’s music. 
Vera (Karlsson) are a visual artist and musician making ‘abruptions’ on the London-Berlin continuum, 
via Frankfurt. They have played everywhere along the way, sometimes as Vanessa Cognizance, 
Hunterc44t (with Still House Plants’ Finlay Clark), or Dana Rosa. They are also a regular contributor 
to recent intercontinental club night of note, The Ladies Club (TLC23).

 <a href="https://primordialvoid.bandcamp.com/album/dana-rosa"target="_blank">Dana Rosa ep</a>
The first release from collaborators Vera Karlsson and
Finlay Clark (Still House Plants), Dana Rosa melds together a
smeared and multi-directional cauldron of soulful drone, whispers of
the heart, ear-splitting bedroom-angst, meandering electronics and
playful percussive textures made by dragging the mic around the
studio.

It was a shared studio in south London. The glass ceiling drank in
the sunlight and held its heavy pregnant body suspended, buoyant,
in the air. There were gaps in the broken bricks and glass that
allowed a corporeal torrent of dried, anfractuous brambles and ivy
to dominate the airspace like blind aliens. Birds fed their young in
the nest situated amongst the drill bits. The young were soon
starved to death by the occupant cuckoo that also hatched there.
The coffee was so strong that it seemed to push the sweat out and
the heavy air held my hand like a lost child looking for someone,
anyone, in this tired and incessant oblivion.

Fermata, 2021, a collaboration between Vera Karlsson and <a href="https://uglyducklingpresse.org/contributors/iman-mohammed/"target="_blank">
Iman Mohammed </a>, the video is a result from our meeting at Gotland film institute, in Gotland, 
Sweden for a four days during summer 2021. The work documents Iman's memores and relationship 
to the iland and specfic the penincula Fårö. Gotland is also the place where I grew up and our friendship
was formed later in Stockholm during 2009. The work discuss the impliations of beloning 
to a place and what that means. It ia also a portrait of Iman Mohammed, 
and includes the cinema and music that inspires her work as a poet. Specificly are Lost Highway and 
Cuadecuc, vampir, qouted in the film. The work also has an undertone of Ingmar Bergamns film Persona,
that also is set on Fårö. The title comes from Iman's second poerty collection "Fermata" (2018)
which she reads from. I filmed, edited and made the soundtrack for the work. It was first showed at Leech in London, 2021.
